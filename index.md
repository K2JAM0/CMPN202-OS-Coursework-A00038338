# CMPN202 Operating Systems Coursework Journal (A00038338)
This GitHub Pages journal documents my weekly progress (Weeks 1–7) for CMPN202 Operating Systems.  
I deployed a headless Ubuntu Server VM and administered it remotely from a Fedora workstation VM over an isolated host-only network.  

 I planned and justified distribution choices, implemented security controls (SSH hardening, firewall restrictions, AppArmor/SELinux checks, automatic updates, Fail2Ban), created monitoring and baseline scripts, performed performance testing (disk/network/Apache), and completed a security audit using Lynis and Nmap.

 ## AI Use Declaration 
 I used AI to help me structure my weekly journal (skeleton/layout), improve grammar/clarity, and to explain concepts/commands so I could understand what I was doing before running them.
All commands, configurations, screenshots, logs, and performance/security results are from my own VirtualBox lab environment. I did not submit “made up” results. I only included steps that I could reproduce.
