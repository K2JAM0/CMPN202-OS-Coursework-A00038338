Week 7 — Phase 7: Security Audit (Lynis + nmap) & System Evaluation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LYNIS AUDIT (Before/After)
sudo apt install lynis -y
sudo lynis audit system
# Save log:

![Lynis hardening index (before)](images/week7/lynis-index-before.png)
*Figure 1: Lynis hardening index captured before applying final remediation steps (Hardening index: 65).*

![Lynis hardening index (after)](images/week7/lynis-index-after.png)
*Figure 1: Lynis hardening index captured after applying remediation (Hardening index remained 65).*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NMAP SCAN (workstation -> server, host-only network only)
sudo apt install nmap -y
nmap 192.168.56.10
![Nmap basic scan](images/week7/nmap-basic-scan.png)
*Figure 3: Basic Nmap scan of the Ubuntu server over the host-only network,
showing only required ports exposed.*

nmap -sV 192.168.56.10
![Nmap service version scan](images/week7/nmap-service-scan.png)
*Figure 4: Nmap service and version detection scan identifying SSH and Apache
services running on the Ubuntu server.*

| Port | Service | Purpose | Security Measures |
|----|----|----|----|
| 22 | SSH | Remote administration | Key-based auth, UFW IP restriction, Fail2Ban |
| 80 | HTTP | Apache web service | Local testing only, no external exposure |
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SERVICE INVENTORY + JUSTIFICATION
sudo ss -tulnp
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

![Service inventory](images/week7/service-inventory.png)
*Figure 6: Active network services and running system services on the Ubuntu server,
used to identify exposed ports and justify required services.*

| Service | Port | Why Needed | Security Measures |
|------|------|-----------|------------------|
| sshd | 22 | Remote administration | Key-based auth, UFW IP restriction, Fail2Ban |
| apache2 | 80 | Web server testing | Local-only access, firewall controlled |
| systemd-resolved | — | DNS resolution | Local system service |
| cron | — | Scheduled tasks | Restricted to system users |

Only essential services are running on the Ubuntu server.
Exposed network services are limited to SSH and HTTP, both of which are
secured using firewall rules, authentication controls, and intrusion prevention.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HARDENING ACTIONS (based on Lynis warnings)
Change 1: Automatic security updates enabled 
Evidence before/after: unattended-upgrades service confirmed active

![Unattended upgrades enabled](images/week7/unattended-upgrades-status.png)
*Figure 8: unattended-upgrades service active, enabling automatic installation of security updates.*

Change 2: Firewall tightened to allow only required services (SSH, HTTP)
Evidence before/after: UFW status showing restricted inbound rules

![UFW status after hardening](images/week7/ufw-status.png)
*Figure 5: UFW enabled with default deny incoming, allowing SSH only from 192.168.56.20 (Fedora workstation).*


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LYNIS AUDIT (After) + COMPARISON
sudo lynis audit system
sudo cp /var/log/lynis.log ~/lynis-after.log
grep 'Hardening index' ~/lynis-before.log
grep 'Hardening index' ~/lynis-after.log

showing the updated hardening index and improved security posture.*
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REMAINING RISKS + RATIONALE
Risk 1: Apache HTTP service exposed on port 80

Why accepted:
Apache is intentionally exposed for performance testing and benchmarking.
Firewall rules restrict administrative access, and the service is monitored.

Risk 2: No HTTPS (TLS) enabled

Why accepted:
The server operates in an isolated host-only lab network.
TLS configuration is outside the scope of performance-focused testing
and would add overhead that affects benchmark accuracy.
