Week 3 — Phase 3: Application Selection for Performance Testing
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
APPLICATION SELECTION MATRIX (you fill)
Workload types to cover: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network, Server/response time.
Apps you might use: stress/stress-ng, dd, iperf3, apache/httpd + ab, scp transfer tests.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INSTALLATION COMMANDS (server via SSH) — paste exact commands you ran
Ubuntu example:
The following applications were installed on the Ubuntu Server via SSH
from the Fedora workstation:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stress-ng sysstat iotop iperf3 apache2 -y

![Application installation](images/week3/app-installation.png)
*Figure 1: Apache HTTP server active and running on ubuntu

Fedora example:
sudo dnf install stress-ng sysstat iotop iperf3 httpd -y
[IF YOU TESTED ON FEDORA, DOCUMENT IT]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXPECTED RESOURCE PROFILES (write predictions before testing)

- CPU app expected: stress-ng will drive CPU usage close to 100% across available cores.
- Memory app expected: stress-ng memory workers will significantly increase RAM usage.
- I/O app expected: dd will cause high disk write throughput and increased I/O wait.
- Network app expected: iperf3 will saturate host-only network bandwidth.
- Server app expected: Apache under ab load will increase CPU usage and response latency.

MONITORING STRATEGY PER APP
What metrics will you record for each app and how will you capture evidence?

For each application, system metrics will be monitored remotely via SSH.
CPU and memory usage will be captured using htop, mpstat, and free.
Disk activity will be monitored using iotop and iostat.
Network performance will be measured using iperf3 and ss.
Evidence will be collected as terminal outputs and selective screenshots.
