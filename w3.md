Week 3 — Phase 3: Application Selection for Performance Testing
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
APPLICATION SELECTION MATRIX (you fill)
Workload types to cover: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network, Server/response time.
Apps you might use: stress/stress-ng, dd, iperf3, apache/httpd + ab, scp transfer tests.
Workload Type 	     Application          Purpose
CPU	                  stress-ng	          Generate sustained CPU load across multiple cores
Memory	              stress-ng          	Allocate and pressure system RAM
Disk I/O       	      dd	                Measure sequential disk write/read performance
Network       	      iperf3	            Measure bandwidth and throughput on host-only network
Server /Response Time	Apache + ab         Measure HTTP response time and request handling under load 

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INSTALLATION COMMANDS (server via SSH)

I installed the selected tools on the Ubuntu server **via SSH from my Fedora workstation**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y stress-ng sysstat iotop iperf3 apache2 apache2-utils

Fedora was used solely as the administrative workstation for remote monitoring and SSH access.
All my performance testing applications were installed and executed on the Ubuntu Server only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXPECTED RESOURCE PROFILES (predictions before testing)

- CPU app expected: stress-ng will drive CPU usage close to 100% across available cores.
- Memory app expected: stress-ng memory workers will significantly increase RAM usage.
- I/O app expected: dd will cause high disk write throughput and increased I/O wait.
- Network app expected: iperf3 will saturate host-only network bandwidth.
- Server app expected: Apache under ab load will increase CPU usage and response latency.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MONITORING STRATEGY PER APP
What metrics will you record for each app and how will you capture evidence?

For each application, system metrics will be monitored remotely via SSH.
CPU and memory usage will be captured using htop, mpstat, and free.
Disk activity will be monitored using iotop and iostat.
Network performance will be measured using iperf3 and ss.
Evidence will be collected as terminal outputs and selective screenshots.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

My reflection: I chose an application that represents different workload types 
so that the testing in future weeks is not random. I installed everything on Ubuntu
via SSH. I also wrote prediciotns for what resources each tool would stress, so that
I can compare what i expected to happen with what actually happened
