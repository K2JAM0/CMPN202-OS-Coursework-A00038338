Week 2 — Phase 2: Security Planning & Performance Testing Methodology
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PERFORMANCE TESTING PLAN (remote methodology)

Planned data table (to fill in Week 6):
Test Case | App/Workload | CPU % | RAM MB | Disk R/W | Net Mbps | Notes
Baseline idle | N/A | | | | | |
Under load | [app] | | | | | |
After optimisation | [app] | | | | | |


Method:
- I will administer and monitor the Ubuntu Server remotely from the Fedora workstation using SSH over the host-only network.
- During testing weeks, I will collect metrics in three states: (1) baseline idle, (2) under load, (3) after optimisation.

Remote metric collection approach:
- Run commands from workstation like:
  ssh kuval@192.168.56.10 "<command>"
- Save outputs into timestamped files for later tables and graphs.

Planned metrics + tools (commands to be used later):
- CPU: mpstat / top
- Memory: free -h / vmstat
- Disk I/O: iostat -x / iotop
- Network: ss -s / ping / iperf3 (inside host-only network)

Evidence plan:
- Week 2: screenshot of successful SSH from Fedora → Ubuntu
- Week 6: tables + graphs built from saved outputs

SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST (plan)

□ SSH hardening: keys-only, disable password auth, disable root login

*Figure 1: SSH server configuration on Ubuntu with root login and password authentication disabled, enforcing key-based remote access only.*

□ Firewall: allow SSH only from workstation IP (192.168.56.20), default deny inbound

sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    192.168.56.20

The Ubuntu server firewall (UFW) was configured to deny all incoming connections 
by default, allowing SSH access only from the Fedora workstation (192.168.56.20).



□ MAC: Ubuntu AppArmor (verify status), Fedora SELinux enforcing (verify with sestatus)
□ Automatic security updates: enable unattended upgrades (Ubuntu)
□ fail2ban: protect SSH logins

□ User privilege management: non-root admin user, controlled sudo access
□ Network isolation: host-only for admin traffic, NAT only for updates

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THREAT MODEL (minimum 3)

Threat 1: SSH brute-force login attempts
Mitigation: keys-only SSH + restrict SSH source IP + fail2ban

Threat 2: Unnecessary services increase attack surface
Mitigation: service audit (systemctl), disable/remove non-essential services, firewall default deny

Threat 3: Privilege escalation through weak user/sudo configuration
Mitigation: non-root admin user, least privilege with sudo, regular security updates

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REFLECTION

Security vs performance/usability trade-offs anticipated:
- Restricting SSH to one IP improves security but reduces flexibility for admin access.
- fail2ban/logging improves security visibility but adds small overhead (CPU/disk writes).
- Stronger MAC enforcement improves containment but may require extra configuration to avoid blocking legitimate services.
